        Trips made by New York City's iconic yellow taxis. 
        Yellow taxis are the only vehicles permitted to respond to a street hail from a passenger in all five
        boroughs. They may also be hailed using an e-hail app like Curb or Arro.
        The records were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by
        technology service providers.
