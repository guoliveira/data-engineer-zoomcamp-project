## Development Steps

This capstone followed these general development steps:
1. Started a Google Cloud Platform free account (this step was skipped since we already built before for the zoomcamp);
2. Creation of GCP project with the name "Capstone-Luis-Oliveira" and followed the advanced steps in [here](https://github.com/guoliveira/data-engineer-zoomcamp-project/tree/main/GCP_Terraform)
3. Creation of a GCP infrastructure using Terraform. The steps are also in the same link above;
