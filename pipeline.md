#Data pipeline ðŸª 

The main goal of my pipeline was to extract data from NOAA dataset into GCP Storage in the raw format and refined format (after transformation)

Therefore, according to the project objectives, I build two data pipelines for:
1. To load the data of the Portuguese weather station. And all weather stations in the raw format.
2. Load data of the weather dataset of last 20 years in raw format. And load Portuguese temperature data of the last 20 years.
